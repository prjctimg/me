## Introduction

High level programming languages have changed the way we write code by taking away some of the programming routines that were usually done by hand such as garbage collection. 

However, they can also be a trap when you're just getting started with programming because most of the syntax abstracts what's going on under the hood. For example, very few people understand the intricate details of JavaScript's `Array` methods and what the perfomance tradeoffs are. In truth, these things don't matter if you're still trying to `console.log` 'Hello world' to the screen but this changes when you start to do computationally expensive tasks. You'd be surprised to see how much difference a few hundred milliseconds contribute to the overall perfomance of your program.

In this post, I'll share why I'm transitioning to a more low level niche of the field. It's not a path for everyone but it wouldn't hurt to just go one level deeper so as to have a more unified view of how software works. 


## I had zero understanding of memory in computers

Okay, I'm confident that I'm not the only one who has been living ignorant about how memory works in computers. All I knew was that by declaring a variable, I was assigning a value to the memory which could be referred to later on in the program. That's it, the rest was just magic for me (most of it still is 👀).

## I didn't want to build CRUD apps

Web development sucks. I'd rather pepper my eyes with hot chilli than ever work with XML and CSS again.

From the constantly changing web development best practices to overhyped frameworks that 'simplify the developer experience' by shipping the most commonly used features so that developers can focus on building business. The only problem with this practice in JS is that things can change overnight, dependencies break and all of a sudden the build process fails, which can take you down a rabbit hole.

I can't handle this, I'm a man who's slow to adopt to change and refactoring codebases for silly websites isn't exactly my dream when I chose the field.

## Steep competition in frontend development

Let's be honest for a while, the frontend is overcrowded right now. Because of all the AI powered design tools out there, it has become really difficult to be noticed as a frontend developer.

Because of the lower learning curve of frontend development due to recent developments of low code tools, the frontend field began to feel "limiting" for me. My mentality towards JS became aligned with frameworks/tools. I was failing to truly appreciate the beauty of the language as it was. Learning through these abstractions was an evil that made me, for a moment feel as if I was a competent programmer, when in actual reality I wasn't. I was just putting together solutions devised by others. I felt like a complete phony, because I knew that there was more to learn beyond centering a `div`.

## IoT in agriculture ? Maybe

As someone with a foundational background in CS (Crop Science) but later realised that mitochondria and microscopes were'nt my thing, I feel like I can somehow bridge the two worlds. Technology is really flexible when you take the time to understand the problem at hand.


This means I now need to understand, for example, how sensors which can detect fluctuations in the environment can be used to do useful stuff. Which also means I need to know how to work with embedded systems (more C/Rust). 

At this point however, I think my main goal is to see how applicable these ideas may be. There's always room for improvement

## I suck at design tools

Don't get me wrong on this, the design tools out there are great but for someone with a very short attention span like me, clicking dropdown menus and dragging and dropping stuff around the screen doesn't necessarily spark an excitement in me anymore. Design tools make more sense when you know CSS and I barely understand much beyond the basic properties. 

Basing my entire career on a proprietary software that could get outdated any day is a risk too big to take. Just as one should know the programming language itself instead of libraries/frameworks.

But hey, someone is making a decent living with it so, you do you at the end of the day 😎.

## Algorist on weekends

> An algorist is an artist that draws using algorithms.

Algorithmic art was what I really loved when I first started learning JavaScript. Think of p5.js and zimjs 🧑‍🎨. Having fun is a necessity especially if that hobby can be done within your field. 

I wrote a fun library for doing all kinds of stuff with color which I intend to use in my future projects, I'll keep you updated on how that turns out.

## And also I needed a job 👀 💼

Some of the usually open positions in the country at the moment require the knowledge of **real programming languages** like Java or C. 

The industry uses really boring languages can you imagine writing `public static void main` for the rest of your life ? But that's the reality of being a programmer, you have to be willing to take up the technical challenges as they come.

Besides I'm not getting any younger and my financial commitments are getting rabid by the day.
